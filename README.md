# Weekly_Payroll_Generator_Java
The program is dedicated to solving a specific scenario that involves creating an automatic payroll for multiple types of employees in an efficient manner.

Background: This summer you have an internship at a small local manufacturing
business. Mr. Graham —— the owner of the business —— wants to modernize his
business a little bit. He thought that automating his weekly payroll is a
good first step.

On your first day, Mr. Graham asks you to stop by his office. After offering
you coffee or water, he says that he needs your help with many projects
around his business. Next, he explains to you how his people are getting
paid.

There are four types of employees who work for Mr. Graham:
1. A boss is paid a weekly salary.
2. A commission worker is paid a weekly salary in addition to a commission
on every piece he/she sells.
3. A piece worker is paid a fee for each item he/she produces.
4. An hourly worker is paid by the hour. The hourly rate is one and half
for hours beyond the first 40 hours.

It would be a great help to Mr. Graham if you can generate a weekly payroll
report. In this report, the name (first and last), the employee
identification number, the position, and the weekly earnings are displayed
for each employee.
